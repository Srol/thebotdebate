Good evening, I'm Carl Quintanilla, with my colleagues Becky Quick and John Harwood.
We'll be joined tonight by some of CNBC's top experts on the markets and personal finance.
Let's get through the rules of the road.
Candidates get 30 seconds to answer the opening question, 60 seconds to answer a formal question, 30 seconds for follow-ups and rebuttals, all at the discretion of the moderators.
We want you to weigh in from home.
You'll see your tweets at the bottom of the screen.
Use the hashtag, #cNBCgopdebate.
You can also go to cNBC.com/vote to tell us where you stand throughout the night.
So let's introduce the candidates for tonight's Republican presidential debate.
A lot to get to tonight.
So let's get started.
This first is an open question.
This series of debates is essentially a job interview with the American people.
And in any job interview, you know this: you get asked, "what's your biggest weakness?" So in 30 seconds, without telling us that you try too hard or that you're a perfectionist…
Governor?
Governor Huckabee.
Thank you, Governor.
Governor Bush.
Senator Rubio.
Mr. Trump?
Dr. Carson?
Mrs. Fiorina?
Fixed it.
Senator Cruz?
Governor Christie?
Senator Paul?
Thanks to all the candidates.
John?
Mr. Trump, you've done very well in this campaign so far by promising to build a wall and make another country pay for it.
Send 11 million people out of the country.
Cut taxes $10 trillion without increasing the deficit.
And make Americans better off because your greatness would replace the stupidity and incompetence of others.
Let's be honest.
We're at the 60 seconds.
We're at 60 seconds, but I gotta ask you, you talked about your tax plan.
You say that it would not increase the deficit because you cut taxes $10 trillion in the economy would take off like…
Hold on, hold on.
The economy would take off like a rocket ship.
I talked to economic advisers who have served presidents of both parties.
They said that you have as chance of cutting taxes that much without increasing the deficit as you would of flying away from that podium by flapping your arms.
The Tax Foundation says — has looked at all of our plans and — and his creates, even with the dynamic effect, $8 trillion dollar deficit… Gentlemen — we'll — we'll get back to this — just a minute — just a minute we're gonna continue this.
I wanna talk taxes…
Hold it.
We'll cut it back to you in just a minute.
Becky's moving on.
Dr. Carson, let's talk about taxes.
You have a flat tax plan of 10 percent flat taxes, and — I've looked at it — and this is something that is very appealing to a lot of voters, but I've had a really tough time trying to make the math work on this.
If you were to took a 10 percent tax, with the numbers right now in total personal income, you're gonna come in with bring in $1.5 trillion.
That is less than half of what we bring in right now.
And by the way, it's gonna leave us in a $2 trillion hole.
So what analysis got you to the point where you think this will work?
I — I understand that, but if you — if you look at the numbers you probably have to get to 28.
15 percent still leaves you with a $1.1 trillion hole.
You'd have to cut — you'd have to cut government about 40 percent to make it work with a $1.1 trillion hole.
That is true, I looked at the numbers.
Dr. Carson, thank you.
Governor Kasich, hold it, I'm coming to you right now.
The…
Well, I'm asking you about this.
I'm about to ask you about this.
That is, you had some very strong words to say yesterday about what's happening in your party and what you're hearing from the two gentlemen we've just heard from.
Would you repeat it?
Well, let's just get more pointed about it.
You said yesterday that you were hearing proposals that were just crazy from your colleagues.
Who were you talking about?
Governor — Governor.
thank you, Governor.
Mr. Trump, 30 seconds.
Governor…
Thank you, Governor.
Dr. Carson, let me get 30 seconds with Dr. Carson…
Thank you.
Senator — Senator, thank you.
Gentlemen, I'm sorry, we need to…
We're going to try to move on.
You want to bring 70,000 pages to three?
Is that using really small type?
Is that using really small type?
Mrs. Fiorina —
We're going to —
We're going to move on.
We will come around the bend, i promise.
This one is for Senator Rubio.
You've been a young man in a hurry ever since you won your first election in your 20s.
You've had a big accomplishment in the Senate, an immigration bill providing a path to citizenship the conservatives in your party hate, and even you don't support anymore.
Now, you're skipping more votes than any senator to run for president.
Why not slow down, get a few more things done first or least finish what you start?
So when the Sun-Sentinel says Rubio should resign, not rip us off, when they say Floridians sent you to Washington to do a job, when they say you act like you hate your job, do you?
Well, do you hate your job?
Is that the standard?
Senator, thank you.
John.
Thirty seconds.
Thank you, Senator.
Hold on.
I think there's a — I've got question for —
Hold on, Governor.
I've got a question for Governor Bush.
No, we're moving to Governor Bush.
Governor, the fact that you're at the fifth lectern tonight shows how far your stock has fallen in this race, despite the big investment your donors have made.
You noted recently, after slashing your payroll, that you had better things to do than sit around and be demonized by other people.
I wanted to ask you —
OK.
Got it.
But it's a — OK.
It's a — it's a question about why you're having difficulty.
I want to ask you in this context.
Ben Bernanke, who was appointed Fed chairman by your brother, recently wrote a book in which he said he no longer considers himself a Republican because the Republican Party has given in to know- nothingism.
Is that why you're having a difficult time in this race?
Thank you, Governor.
We're gonna get down the line.
Becky's got a question.
We'll get to everyone.
Ms.
Fiorina, I — I'd like to ask you a question.
You are running for president of the United States because of your record running Hewlett-Packard.
But the stock market is usually a fair indicator of the performance of a CEO, and the market was not kind to you.
Someone who invested a dollar in your company the day you took office had lost half of the dollar by the day you left.
Obviously, you've talked in the past about what a difficult time it was for technology companies, but anybody who was following the market knows that your stock was a much worse performer, if you looked at your competitors, if you looked at the overall market.
I just wonder, in terms of all of that — you know, we look back, your board fired you.
I just wondered why you think we should hire you now.
Mrs. Fiorina, it's interesting that you bring up Mr. Perkins, because…
Mrs. Fiorina.
Thank you, we're out of time.
Thank you, Mrs. Fiorina.
Carl.
Senator Cruz.
Congressional Republicans, Democrats and the White House are about to strike a compromise that would raise the debt limit, prevent a government shutdown and calm financial markets that fear of — another Washington-created crisis is on the way.
Does your opposition to it show that you're not the kind of problem-solver American voters want?
(inaudible) do we get credit (inaudible)?
So, this is a question about (inaudible), which you have 30 seconds left to answer, should you choose to do so.
OK.
(inaudible) I asked you about the debt limit and I got no answer.
Senator Paul, I've got a question for you on the same subject.
Senator Paul?
You used your time on something else.
Senator Paul?
Senator Paul, the budget deal crafted by Speaker Boehner and passed by the House today makes cuts in entitlement programs, Medicare and Social Security disability, which are the very programs conservatives say need cutting to shrink government and solve our country's long-term budget deficit.
Do you oppose that budget deal because it doesn't cut those programs enough?
Senator, if what you just said is true, why did Speaker Boehner craft this deal and why did Paul Ryan, who has a strong reputation for fiscal discipline, vote for it?
Thank you, Senator (inaudible).
Governor Christie, I'd like to (inaudible) a question next.
Actually, I have a question for you (inaudible).
In your tell it like it is campaign, you've said a lot of tough things.
You've said that we need to raise the retirement age for Social Security.
You think that we need to cut benefits for people who make over $80,000 and eliminate them entirely for seniors who are making over $200,000.
Governor Huckabee, who is here on the stage, has said that you and others who think this way are trying to rob seniors of the benefits that they've earned.
It raises the question: When it is acceptable to break a social compact?
…Governor…
…Thank you.
We promised we would get to everyone this block.
Governor Huckabee, I'm going to give you 60 seconds on this.
…Governor…
…Thank you, Governor…
…Senator Cruz…
OK, alright.
Senator Cruz…
…Before we go to break, we're clearly not having that beer you mentioned, but I'll give you 30 more seconds…
OK.
I'll give you 30 seconds to respond…
(INAUDIBLE)
Respond on the debt limit, or an answer to the governor, which ever you choose.
30 seconds, Governor Huckabee.
Governor, thank you.
We will take a break.
The Republican Presidential debate, live from Boulder, Colorado, coming back after a break on CNBC.
Welcome back to the presidential debate for the Republicans.
We are live in Boulder, Colorado, right here on CNBC.
Folks, we'll get right back into this.
Mr. Trump, let's talk a little bit about bankruptcies.
Your Atlantic City casinos filed for bankruptcy four times.
In fact, Fitch, the ratings agency, even said that they were serial filers for all of this.
You said that you did great with Atlantic City, and you did.
But some of the individuals — the bondholders, some of the contractors who worked for you, didn't fare so well.
Bankruptcy is a broken promise.
Why should the voters believe the promises that you're telling them right now?
Mr. Trump, thank you.
Dr. Carson, in recent weeks, a number of pharmaceutical companies has been accused of profiteering, for dramatically raising the prices of life-saving drugs.
You have spent a lifetime in medicine.
Have these companies gone too far? Should the government be involved in controlling some of these price increases?
Thank you, Dr. Carson.
Governor Christie, there has been a lot of political rhetoric that some bank executives should have gone to jail for the 2008 financial crisis.
But General Motors paid more than $1 billion in fines and settlements for its ignition switch defect.
One hundred and twenty- four people died as a result of these faulty switches.
No one went to jail.
As a former prosecutor, do you believe the people responsible for the switch and the cover-up belong behind bars?
Thank you, Governor Christie.
Jim, thanks.
Governor Bush, in a debate like this four years ago, every Republican running for president pledged to oppose a budget deal containing any tax increase even if it had spending cuts ten times as large.
A few months later, you told Congress, put me in, coach, you said you would take that deal.
Still feel that way?
But to — to the point that you made to Congress, if you were president and you were offered a bipartisan deal that had one dollar…
…one dollar of tax increases per ten dollars of spending cuts, would you take it?
So you don't want the coach to put you in any more?
Thank you, governor.
Carl?
Mrs. Fiorina, in 2010, while running for Senate in Tech Ridge (ph), California, you called an Internet sales tax a bad idea.
Traditional brick and mortar stores obviously disagree.
Now that the Internet shopping playing field has matured, what would be a fair plan to even that playing field?
Mrs. Fiorina.
OK.
Thank you very much.
Senator, I understand all of that.
I had a lot of student loans when I got out, too.
But you've had a windfall that a lot of Americans haven't.
You made over a million dollars on a book deal, and some of these problems came after that.
But you — but you liquidated that retirement account after the fact, and that cost you about $24,000 out of that in taxes and feed.
That — that was after you'd already come into that windfall.
That's why I raised the question.
Governor John Kasich, you've called for abolishing the Export Import Bank, which provides subsidies to help American companies compete with overseas competitors.
You call that corporate welfare.
One of the largest newspapers in your state wrote an editorial, said they found that strange, writing, that if that's corporate welfare, what does Kasich call the millions of dollars in financial incentives doled out to attract or retain jobs by his development effort — jobs Ohio.
If subsidies are good enough for Ohio companies, why aren't they good enough for companies trying to compete overseas?
Thank you, Governor.
Thank you, Governor.
Thank you.
Yes, thank you John.
Senator Cruz, working women in this country still earn just 77 percent of what men earn.
And I know that you've said you've been very sympathetic to our cause.
But you've also you said that the Democrats' moves to try and change this are the political show votes.
I just wonder what you would do as President to try and help in this cause?
Mrs. Fiorina —
Mrs. Fiorina, we will come back to you.
Thank you, Mrs. Fiorina.
Carl?
Dr. Carson, we know you as a physician, but we wanted to ask you about your involvement on some corporate boards, including Costco's.
Last year, a marketing study called the warehouse retailer the number one gay-friendly brand in America, partly because of its domestic partner benefits.
Why would you serve on a company whose policies seem to run counter to your views on homosexuality?
To be fair, you were on the homepage of their website with the logo over your shoulder —
Does that not speak to your vetting process or judgment in any way.
Apparently.
We will take a break.
We'll be back in Boulder in just a minute.
Welcome back to the Republican presidential debate on CNBC, live from Boulder, Colorado at the University of Colorado.
Senator Huckabee, I mean — excuse me — Senator Rubio, Wired magazine recently carried the heading, "Marco Rubio wants to be the tech industry's savior." It noted your support for dramatically increasing immigration visas called H1B, which are designed for workers with the special skills that Silicon Valley wants.
But your Senate colleague, Jeff Sessions of Alabama, says in reality, the tech industry uses this program to undercut hiring and wages for highly qualified Americans.
Why is he wrong?
It sounds like you think Senator Sessions is wrong to believe there is enough abuse in that program that we shouldn't…
Thank you, Senator.
Becky?
Mr. Trump, let's stay on this issue of immigration.
You have been very critical of Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook who has wanted to increase the number of these H1Bs.
So you're in favor of…
You know, Mr. — you know, Mr. Trump, if I may (inaudible).
You've been — you have been — you had talked a little bit about Marco Rubio.
I think you called him Mark Zuckerberg's personal senator because he was in favor of the H1B.
So this was an erroneous article the whole way around?
My apologies.
I'm sorry.
Yes, you can.
Senator Rubio, thank you very much.
I would like to introduce my colleague, Rick Santelli, he has some comments as well, sir.
Senator Cruz, let's focus on our central bank, the Federal Reserve.
You've been a fierce critic of the Fed, arguing for more transparency.
Where do you want to take that?
Do you want to get Congress involved in monetary policy, or is it time to slap the Fed back and downsize them completely? What are your thoughts? What do you believe?
Senator Paul, the same question to you.
Thank you, Senator.
You know, Mr. Trump, if I may…
Just a minute, Ms.
Fiorina, let me follow up on this for just a moment.
You talked a little bit about Marco Rubio.
I think you called him "Mark Zuckerberg's personal senator" because he was in favor H- 1B…
So this was an erroneous article the whole way around?
My apologies.
I'm sorry…
Yes.
Yes, you may.
Senator Rubio, thank you very much.
I would like to introduce my colleague, Rick Santelli, he has some comments as well, sir.
Senator Cruz, let's focus on our central bank, the Federal Reserve.
You've been a fierce critic of the Fed, arguing for more transparency.
Where do you want to take that?
Do you want to get Congress involved in monetary policy, or is it time to slap the Fed back and downsize them completely? What are your thoughts? What do you believe?
Senator Paul, the same question to you.
Thank you, Senator.
Thank you, Doctor.
Becky?
Rick, thank you very much.
Governor Huckabee, you have railed against income inequality.
You've said that some Wall Street executives should have gone to jail over the roles that they played during the financial crisis.
Apart from your tax plan, are there specific steps you would require from corporate America to try and reduce the income inequality.
Governor?
Governor?
Thank you.
Now, everybody else has fudged their time and gone over, so please, don't cut me off too quick, Becky.
All right, Governor Huckabee.
How about 15 more seconds?
Governor?
Governor, I'm sorry…
Governor, thank you.
Governor Bush, the tax reform bill that Ronald Reagan signed in 1986 cut the top personal income tax rate to 28 percent — just like your plan does.
But President Reagan taxed capital gains at the same rate, while you would tax them at just 20 percent.
Given the problems we've been discussing, growing gap between rich and poor, why would you tax labor at a higher rate than income from investments?
Senator Rubio, 30 seconds to you.
The Tax Foundation, which was alluded to earlier, scored your tax plan and concluded that you give nearly twice as much of a gain in after-tax income to the top 1 percent as to people in the middle of the income scale.
Since you're the champion of Americans living paycheck-to- paycheck, don't you have that backward?
The Tax Foundation — just to be clear, they said the…
No, I did not.
Senator, the Tax Foundation said after-tax income for the top 1 percent under your plan would go up 27.9 percent.
And people in the middle of the income spectrum, about 15 percent.
(inaudible)
Senator, thank you.
…We'll come back around.
I want to get to governor Kasich.
It's at the moderator discretion.
Governor Kasich, let's talk …
…about Marijuana, Governor Kasich…
Alright, but 30 seconds, you made a case.
Sure, 30 seconds.
Senator, thank you.
Oh, no, no, no…
…Ok…
…We're going to go to…
OK.
Thank you, Senator.
Governor Kasich, let's talk about marijuana.
We're broadcasting from Colorado which has seen $150 million in new revenue for the state since legalizing last year.
Governor Hickenlooper is not a big fan of legalization, but he's said the people who used to be smoking it are still smoking it, they're just now paying taxes.
Given the budget pressures in Ohio, and other states, is this a revenue stream you'd like to have?
Thank you, Governor.
Thank you.
We'll be back from Boulder, Colorado in just a moment.
Welcome back to the University of Colorado and the Republican presidential debate right here on CNBC.
Mr. Trump, I want to go back to an issue that we were talking about before, the H-1B visas.
I found where I read that before.
It was from the donaldjtrump.com website and it says — it says that again, Mark Zuckerburg's personal senator, Marco Rubio has a bill to triple H-1Bs that would decimate women and minorities.
Are you in favor of H-1Bs or are you opposed to them?
Thank you, sir.
You were.
You get 30 seconds.
Thank you, Senator.
Thank you, Senator.
Carl?
Mr. Trump, you've said you have a special permit to carry a gun in New York.
After the Oregon mass shooting on October 1st, you said, "By the way, it was a gun-free zone.
If you had a couple of teachers with guns, you would have been a hell of a lot better off."
Would you feel more comfortable if your employees brought guns to work?
Are you carrying one now?
We called a few Trump resorts, a few Trump properties that — that do not allow guns with or without a permit.
Would you change those policies?
OK.
All right.
Thank you.
John?
Governor Huckabee, you've written about the huge divide in values between middle America and the big coastal cities like New York and Los Angeles.
As a preacher as well as a politician, you know that presidents need the moral authority to bring the entire country together.
The leading Republican candidate, when you look at the average of national polls right now, is Donald Trump.
When you look at him, do you see someone with the moral authority to unite the country?
Thank you, Governor.
Thank you, Governor.
Don't forget my colleague, Sharon Epperson.
Higher education is the example…
Governor Bush, daily fantasy sports has become a phenomenon in this country, will award billions of dollars in prize money this year.
But to play you have to assess your odds, put money at risk, wait for an outcome that's out of your control.
Isn't that the definition of gambling, and should the Federal Government treat it as such?
I had a feeling you were going to brag about that.
I want to go back, if I can, to the issue of…
I want to go back, if I may, to the… Governor Christie, you've said something that many in your party do not believe, which is that climate change is undeniable, that human activity contributes to it, and you said, quote: "The question is, what do we do to deal with it?".
So what do we do?
What should we do?
You mean government?
Thank you, Governor.
Becky.
Senator Paul, among the leading conservative opponents to the creation of Medicare back in the 1960s was Ronald Reagan.
He warned that it would lead to socialism.
Considering the mounting cost of Medicare, was he right to oppose it?
Senator, thank you.
This is the– well, we're going to take a break.
We want to save time for closing statements after the break.
So this is the Republican presidential debate in Boulder, and we'll be right back.
Welcome back to Boulder, Colorado and the Republican presidential debate right here on CNBC.
Governor Huckabee, you wanted to respond to the points that Senator Rand Paul was just making when it comes to Social Security.
Your time, sir.
Thank you, Governor.
Governor Bush, Mr. Trump says that he is capable of growing the economy so much that Social Security and Medicare don't have to be touched.
Do you want to explain how that is going to happen, Mr. Trump?
Governor.
Governor, thank you.
Senator Paul, let's go back to you.
Do these solutions sound like they work?
Do these solutions sound like they would work?
Hold on, Governor.
I've got a question for — for Dr. Carson.
Yes.
You've said that you would like to replace Medicare with a system of individual family savings accounts, so that families could cover their own expenses.
Obviously, that would be a very controversial idea.
Explain how that would work, exactly.
Thank you, Dr. Carson.
Governor?
Senator Rubio…
Governor, do you also think that…
…yeah, I just wanted (inaudible).
…that Dr. Carson's right, that we can replace Medicare with individual savings accounts?
I want to give you 30 seconds here.
Mrs. Fiorina, we're right at the end of our time.
You all wanted us to limit (inaudible).
All right.
Go ahead.
We have now reached the point in the program where candidates are going to give their closing statements, 30 seconds apiece.
We're going to go right to left and start with you, Senator Paul.
Governor Christie?
Thank you, Governor.
Senator Cruz?
Thank you, Senator.
Mrs. Fiorina?
Thank you, Mrs. Fiorina.
Dr. Carson?
Mr. Trump?
Just for the record, the debate was always going to be two hours.
Senator Rubio?
Senator Rubio.
Thank you, Senator.
Governor Bush?
Thank you, Governor.
Governor Huckabee.
Thank you…
Governor Kasich?
Thank you, Governor.
That concludes tonight's debate.
On behalf of my colleagues Becky Quick, John Harwood, Sharon Epperson, Rick Santelli and Jim Cramer, we'd like to our host, the University of Colorado at Boulder, the Republican National Committee, the candidates and, of course, tonight's audience.
I'm Jake Tapper.
We're live at the Ronald Reagan Library in Simi Valley, California for the main event.
Round 2 of CNN's presidential debate starts now.
The eleven leading Republican candidates for president are at their podiums.
They are ready to face off, and if you've been watching this race, you know anything could happen over the next few hours.
To viewers who are just joining us, welcome to the Air Force One Pavilion of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.
Our thanks to the staff here and especially to former first lady Nancy Reagan for this impressive setting with Ronald Reagan's presidential plane as our backdrop.
This debate is airing on CNN networks in the United States and around the world.
It's also being broadcast on the Salem Radio Network.
I know everyone is very eager to get started.
But first, I want to explain the ground rules tonight.
My name is Jake Tapper.
I'll be the moderator.
I will be joined in the questioning by Salem Radio Network talk show host Hugh Hewitt.
He worked in the Reagan administration for six years.
And by CNN's chief political correspondent Dana Bash.
I will ask follow-up questions, I will attempt to guide the discussion.
Candidates, I will try to make sure each of you gets your fair share of questions.
You'll have one minute to answer and 30 seconds for follow-ups and rebuttals.
I'll give you time to respond if you've been singled out for criticism.
Our viewers should know we have timing lights that are visible to the candidates to warn them when their time is up.
These 11 Republicans are positioned on the stage based on their ranking in recent national polls.
Our goal for this evening is a debate.
A true debate, with candidates addressing each other in areas where they differ.
Where they disagree — on policy, on politics, on leadership.
Now, let's begin.
Senator Cruz?
Thank you one and all for being here.
There are many important policy issues facing our nation.
We're going to get to many of them tonight, but I do want to start off with some current events in the news, and also some of the comments the candidates have recently made on the campaign trail.
Mrs. Fiorina, I want to start with you.
Fellow Republican candidate, and Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, has suggested that your party's frontrunner, Mr. Donald Trump, would be dangerous as President.
He said he wouldn't want, quote, "such a hot head with his finger on the nuclear codes."
You, as well, have raised concerns about Mr. Trump's temperament.
You've dismissed him as an entertainer.
Would you feel comfortable with Donald trump's finger on the nuclear codes?
You didn't answer my question.
Would you feel comfortable with Donald Trump's finger on the nuclear codes? It's an issue that one of your fellow candidates has raised.
Mr. Trump?
Mr. — Senator Paul, your name has been invoked.
Mr. Trump?
I want to — I want to give Mr. Trump…
… Mr. Trump, I want to give you another chance — Mr. Trump, I want to give you a chance to respond to something that your rival to your left, Governor Bush, said.
Governor Bush told me last week when I read him the quote from Governor Jindal that he agrees you're not a serious candidate.
Tell Governor Bush why you are a serious candidate and what your qualifications are to be commander-in-chief.
Governor Bush, would you feel comfortable with Donald Trump's finger on the nuclear codes?
Thank you, Dr. Carson.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you Ms.
Fiorina.
Is there anything else you want to say about this?
Governor — BUSH: You've got, according to your — to what you said on one of the talk shows, you got Hillary Clinton to go to your wedding —
Sure Dr. Carson.
Thank you, Dr. Carson.
Let's move to Russia if we could.
Russia is sending troops and tanks into Syria right now to prop up a U.S.
enemy, Bashar al-Assad.
President Obama's incoming top general says, quote, "Russia presents the greatest threat to our national security."
Mr. Trump, you say you can do business with President Vladimir Putin, you say you will get along, quote, "very well." What would you do right now if you were president, to get the Russians out of Syria?
So, you — just to clarify, the only answer I heard to the question I asked is that you would — you would reach out to Vladimir Putin, and you would do what? You would…
Thank you, Senator Rubio.
I want to bring in Carly Fiorina.
Ms.
Fiorina, you have met…
…yeah, you've met Vladimir Putin.
Yes.
Thank you, Ms.
Fiorina.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, Ms.
Fiorina.
While you're — while you brought up the subject of General Suleimani of the Quds forces from Iran, the next president, no matter who he or she may be, will inherit President Obama's Iran deal.
Senator Cruz, Governor Kasich says that anyone who is promising to rip up the Iran deal on day one, as you have promised to do, is, quote, "inexperienced," and, quote, "playing to a crowd." Respond to Governor Kasich, please.
Why is that not, as Governor Kasich says, playing to the crowd and an example of you being inexperienced?
Governor Kasich…
…Did Senator Cruz just play to the crowd?
…Thank you, Governor.
I want to go to Senator Paul.
I want to go to Senator Paul.
Senator Paul, the White House is rolling out the red carpet next week for the President of China, President Xi.
Governor Walker says that President Obama should cancel the state dinner because of China's currency manipulation, and because of China's alleged cyber attacks against the United States.
Is Governor Walker right?
Governor Walker, Senator Paul seemed to suggest…
…that canceling the state dinner would be rash, and reckless.
…Governor Bush…
Governor Bush, your father was the chief diplomatic envoy to China back when Nixon opened relations to China.
Is Scott Walker's approach the right one, canceling the state dinner?
I want to turn…
…I want to turn to Governor Huckabee who has been very patient.
Somebody had to be 11th, and he is, but, I do want to change the subject to the event that you had…
… however you want, but I want to ask this question.
All right, sir, go ahead.
OK.
We're going to turn now to Hugh Hewitt, from Salem Radio Network.
Thank you, Jake.
Mr. Trump, two years ago, President Obama drew a red line that the Syrian dictator Bashar Assad crossed, President Obama threatened to strike.
He did not, his knees buckled.
We now have 4 million refugees, Syria is a living hell, and he turned to the Congress for the authority to back him up.
You have three senators to your right that said, no.
Do they bear responsibility for this refugee crisis, and what would you have done when Bashar Assad crossed the line?
How much responsibility, Mr. Trump, do the senators hold?
Senator Rubio…
Senator Paul? PAUL: I think this gets to the point of wisdom on when to intervene and when we shouldn't.
Had we bombed Assad at the time, like President Obama wanted, and like Hillary Clinton wanted and many Republicans wanted, I think ISIS would be in Damascus today.
I think ISIS would be in charge of Syria had we bombed Assad.
Sometimes both sides of the civil war are evil, and sometimes intervention sometimes makes us less safe.
This is real debate we have to have in the Middle East.
Every time we have toppled a secular dictator, we have gotten chaos, the rise of radical Islam, and we're more at risk.
So, I think we need to think before we act, and know most interventions, if not a lot of them in the Middle East, have actually backfired on us.
Thank you, Senator Paul.
That would be fair, you're right.
You're the third senator.
We're going to go to Dana Bash…
Senator Cruz?
Thank you, Senator.
Thank you, Senator.
Thank you, Senator.
I want to…
… turn back to Governor Huckabee…
I want to turn back to Governor Huckabee.
Governor Huckabee, last week, you held a rally for a county clerk in Kentucky who was jailed for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, as I don't need to tell you.
You've called what happened to Kim Davis, that clerk, "an example of the criminalization of Christianity." There are several people on the stage who disagree with you.
Governor Bush, for example, says that that clerk is sworn to uphold the law.
Is Governor Bush on the wrong side of the criminalization of Christianity? HUCKABEE: No, I don't think he's on the wrong side of such an issue.
Jeb is a friend.
I'm not up here to fight with Jeb or to fight with anybody else.
But I am here to fight for somebody who is a county clerk elected under the Kentucky constitution that 75 percent of the people of that state had voted for that said that marriage was between a man and a woman.
The Supreme Court in a very, very divided decision decided out of thin air that they were just going to redefine marriage.
It's a decision that the other justices in dissent said they didn't have and there wasn't a constitutional shred of capacity for them to do it.
I thought that everybody here passed ninth-grade civics.
The courts cannot legislate.
That's what Roberts said.
But heck, it's what we learned in civics.
The courts can't make a law.
They can interpret one.
They can review one.
They can't implement it.
They can't force it.
But here's what happened: Because the courts just decided that something was going to be and people relinquished it and the other two branches of government sat by silently — I thought we had three branches of government, they were all equal to each other, we have separation of powers, and we have checks and balances.
If the court can just make a decision and we just all surrender to it, we have what Jefferson said was judicial tyranny.
The reason that this is a real issue that we need to think about…
Thank you, Governor.
Well, I'm not telling you that, Governor.
But Governor Bush is, because he — because he disagrees.
He thinks that Kim Davis swore to uphold the law.
You disagree? You're not — you don't…
OK.
Please do.
You did…
Governor, you said, quote, "she is sworn to uphold the law."
Let me go to my colleague Dana Bash, who has a question.
Governor Kasich, Senator Cruz is so committed to stripping federal funds from Planned Parenthood that it could result in shutting down the federal government in just about two weeks.
Do you agree with Senator Cruz's tactic?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Senator Cruz, I would just add that, on this stage not that long ago, Senator Graham said that this tactic that you're pushing would tank the Republicans' ability to win in 2016.
Thank you, senator.
Thank you…
Governor — governor, I want to go to you.
Is it what Senator Cruz says, a surrender by Republicans?
But…
But is it…
But, governor, the — but, governor, the reality is, in just two weeks' time…
…we are going to be facing a question about whether or not it's enough to shut down the government to make that statement, because there is still a Democrat in the White House.
Do you oppose it or support it?
Yes or no, do you support this shutdown?
We're talking about Planned Parenthood right now.
Can you answer yes or no?
One more time.
I'm sorry, I just want to get the answer.
So you would support a shutdown.
Dana, I want to continue on the subject.
Governor Bush, you recently said while discussing Planned Parenthood, quote, you're "not sure we need a half billion for women's health issues." Now you've since said that you misspoke, you didn't mean to say "women's health issues."
But Donald Trump said that quote, that comment, which Hillary Clinton did seize upon immediately, will haunt you the same way Mitt Romney's 47 percent video haunted him.
Tell Donald Trump why he's wrong.
Thank you, Governor Bush.
Donald Trump, let me just…
The quote was, "I'm not sure we need half a billion dollars for women's health issues." He said he misspoke.
You said that that's going to haunt him.
Why do you think that?
Governor Bush?
I want to — we're going to get to —
Thank you, Governor.
Thank you, Governor.
We're going to — we're going to get to many of these issues.
This — we're still in the first block, believe it or not.
We're going to get to many of these issues, but before we end this block, Ms.
Fiorina, I do want to ask you about this.
In an interview last week in Rolling Stone magazine, Donald Trump said the following about you.
Quote, "Look at that face.
Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?" Mr. Trump later said he was talking about your persona, not your appearance.
Please feel free to respond what you think about his persona.
All right.
On that note, in less than two minutes — we're going to take a very quick break.
In less than two minutes, the most contentious issue on the campaign trail.
And the candidates on the stage are split over how to handle it.
That's coming up next.
Please give some applause to the candidates.
Welcome to CNN's Republican Presidential Debate.
No topic perhaps has been more combustible in this campaign than the issue of immigration.
Mr. Trump, you have called for deporting every undocumented immigrant, Governor Christie has said, quote, "There are not enough law enforcement officers — local, county, state and federal combined — to forcibly deport 11 to 12 million people."
Tell Governor Christie how much your plan will cost, and how you will get it done.
Governor Christie, you and I have talked about this in an interview.
You say that his big wall, his plan to deport 11 to 12 million undocumented immigrants, it sounds great, but it's never going to happen.
Tell him why you're skeptical of his plans?
Thank you, Governor Christie…
I want to bring in Dr. Carson because he too has been skeptical of your plan to immediately deport 11 to 12 million illegal immigrants.
He said, quote, "People who say that have no idea what this entails."
Why do you say that, Dr. Carson?
…Dr. Carson…
With all due respect, you said about Donald Trump's plan to deport 11 to 12 million undocumented immigrants, "People who say that have no idea what this entails."
Why not?
…let's continue the conversation about illegal immigration with Dana Bash.
Governor Bush, Mr. Trump has suggested that your views on immigration are influenced by your Mexican born wife.
He said that, quote, "If my wife were from Mexico, I think I would have a soft spot for people from Mexico." Did Mr. Trump go to far in invoking your wife?
Mr. Trump?
Mr. Trump…
Go ahead.
Ms.
Fiorina — Ms. Fiorina, we're going to come to you, we're going to come to you.
I just want to give Governor Bush a chance to respond to what Mr. Trump said.
OK, on that note, you have criticized Governor Bush for speaking Spanish on the campaign trail.
You said, quote, "He should really set an example by speaking English in the United States."
What's wrong with speaking Spanish?
Thank you, Senator Rubio.
Senator Cruz — Senator Cruz, this week, we learned more about Dr. Carson's plan for the 11 million to 12 million undocumented immigrants in this country.
Dr. Carson proposed giving these undocumented immigrants a six- month grace period to pay back taxes then to let them become guest workers and only to deport people who failed to do that.
Well, how would you say it, sir? I was just reading the Wall Street Journal quote, but please tell us.
OK, from the horse's mouth, Senator Cruz, does that fit your definition of amnesty?
Thank you, Senator.
Senator Rubio…
… I'm not sure…
We'll come back to you — we'll come back to you in one second, sir.
But Senator Rubio, I'm not sure exactly whose plan he's — he's saying is — constitutes amnesty, but I know he has said it about your plan in the past, so I want to give you a chance to respond, then, Dr. Carson, we'll come to you.
Thank you, Senator.
Thank you, Senator.
Senator — Dr. Carson…
Thank you, Dr. Carson.
I want to talk about the issue of birthright citizenship, which — which has emerged since the first debate as — as an a — a major issue in this campaign.
Mr. Trump, you say that babies born in the United States to undocumented immigrants should not any longer get automatic American citizenship.
Ms. Fiorina says that you are pandering on this issue and acting like the politicians that you rail against.
What's your message to Ms.
Fiorina on birthright citizenship?
Ms. Fiorina, the vast majority of countries do not have birthright citizenship…
…Donald Trump is right about that.
Why is it pandering when he's — he says this?
Ms. Fiorina…
Please.
Thank you, Ms. Fiorina.
Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Fiorina.
Mr. Trump, I want to give you the chance to respond…
Senator Paul, I want to bring you in.
Where — where do you stand on the issue of birthright citizenship?
All right.
Senator Paul, thank you so much.
Let's turn to a new topic.
We've received a lot of questions on social media about the economy and about jobs.
We have two CEOs on stage right now.
Ms.
Fiorina, you were CEO of Hewlett Packard.
Donald Trump says you, quote, "ran HP into the ground," you laid off tens of thousands of people, you got viciously fired.
For voters looking to somebody with private-sector experience to create American jobs, why should they pick you and not Donald Trump?
Thank you, Ms. Fiorina.
Thank you, Ms. Fiorina.
Mr. Trump — Mr. Trump, why would you be better at creating jobs than Carly Fiorina?
Ms. Fiorina, I want to give you a chance to respond.
Mr. Trump.
Thank you, Mr. Trump.
Governor Christie's name has been invoked.
I'd like to give him a 30 second opportunity.
Ms.
Fiorina, I want to give you
Governor Kasich, I'm coming to you next, but Ms.
Fiorina's name was mentioned, and I have to give her the opportunity to respond if she wants it.
Thank you.
Thank you, Ms.
Fiorina.
Governor Kasich, I want to come — I'm coming to you.
I'm coming to you.
Let me ask the question.
You can use the time however you want.
Donald Trump says that the hedge fund guys are getting away with murder by paying a lower tax rate.
He wants to raise the taxes of hedge fund managers, as does Governor Bush.
Do you agree?
Thank you, Governor.
Thank you, Governor Kasich.
Governor Huckabee, I want to bring you in on the question of hedge fund managers and taxing them.
You have said that you are bothered by the fact that hedge fund managers pay such a low tax rate and make 2,500 times what people who work for them make.
Do you agree with what Donald Trump and Governor Bush have proposed, raising their tax rates?
Thank you, Governor.
Dr. Carson, you support scrapping the entire tax code and replacing it with a flat tax based on the principal on tithing from the Bible.
If you make $10 billion, you pay $1 billion in taxes, if you make $10, you pay $1 in taxes.
Donald Trump believes in progressive taxation.
He says it's not right that rich people pay the same as the poor.
Tell Donald Trump why his ideas on taxes are wrong.
Mr. Trump…
…What do you think of the flat tax? Do you think it's fair?
Thank you, Mr. Trump.
Senator Paul?
Governor Walker, I want to go to you.
Dr. Carson wants to raise the Federal Minimum Wage, you have called it a lame idea.
Why is raising the Federal Minimum Wage lame?
…Thank you, Governor…
Dr. Carson, Governor Walker didn't really answer the question, but I'll let you respond.
He called raising the Federal Minimum Wage lame, what do you think of that?
Thank you, Dr. Carson…
Let me bring in our partner from Salem Radio Network, Hugh Hewitt.
I'd like to talk about winning because I think all of you are more qualified than former Secretary of State Clinton, and as were the people in the first debate, but there are different styles, and Carly Fiorina, Governor Kasich, you're conveniently located next to each other, and you have different styles.
Governor Kasich, you've been on my show a lot.
You refused to attack Hillary Clinton, you just don't want to go there, you want to do the up with people.
Go, Ohio, OK, and I like that.
Carly Fiorina, I don't have to bring up the Secretary of State — you bring her up, so (inaudible).
Which one of you is wrong? Governor Kasich?
Governor.
Thank you, Governor.
KASICH: I don't intend to do that, and I going to be out there pushing it out — don't worry about me and Hillary.
That will all work out, and I'm from Ohio.
She will not beat me there, I can promise you that.
Carly Fiorina, your style?
Thank you, Ms. Fiorina.
Governor Christie, your name was mentioned.
I want to give you a chance to respond.
Thank you, Governor.
Thank you, Governor Christie.
There is a lot more coming up.
Ahead, a world of trouble.
The challenges that one of these candidates may face in the Oval Office, and how he or she will handle it.
Stay with us.
Welcome back to CNN's Republican Presidential Debate.
Let's turn to some issues now in foreign policy.
Mr. Trump, Senator Rubio said it was, quote, "very concerning to him" that in a recent interview you didn't seem to know the details about some of the enemies the U.S.
faces.
Rubio said, if you don't know the answers to those questions, you will not be able to serve as commander-in-chief.
Please respond to Senator Rubio.
Oh, you're the best interview in America.
… makes an interesting case (ph) here (ph).
Senator Rubio?
Mr. Trump? Senator Rubio seemed to be suggesting that you don't know information that…
All right.
Senator Rubio.
But are you saying that you have the knowledge to be the president that Mr. Trump does not have?
Mr. Trump?
Thank you, Senator Rubio.
I want to turn now to Hugh Hewitt.
Thank you, Jake.
I've done a lot of great interviews with all of you, but, Governor Bush, I talked to you in February about the biggest elephant in a room full of elephants, which is your last name.
And you said you would not be burdened either by your brother or your father's legacy in the Middle East.
And then, a week later, you rolled out your list of foreign policy advisers, and it was a lot of the band getting back together again.
So on behalf of the military that is watching…
…OK, the active duty military that are at the end of the sphere (ph), what kind of a commander in chief is Jeb Bush going to be, and who are the advisers that are new to your team?
Mr. — Mr. Trump.
I want to ask you a question, though, you promised us great leaders.
And I believe that.
But Jeb Bush has laid out 20 different people that have experience around the world.
There are 190 countries, you can't run the world by yourself.
When are we going to get some names on your military and your foreign policy advisers?
Thank you, Governor.
Senator…
Senator Paul?
Senator Paul…
Thank you, Senator Paul…
Thank you, Senator Paul…
I understand that Governor Bush's name has been invoked, and then we can go to you, Senator Rubio.
Thank you, Governor.
Thank you, Governor.
Senator Rubio?
Thank you, Senator.
Dr. Carson?
Thank you, Dr. Carson.
I mean, it is interesting that you say that, because I want to ask Governor Christie about something else that you have said.
Governor Christie, we just marked the 14th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.
Now Dr. Carson has said that if he had been president at the time, the United States would not have gone to war in Afghanistan.
What does that say to you about how Dr. Carson would respond as president if America were attacked again?
Dr. Carson?
… Governor Christie.
Dr. Carson?
Thank you, Dr. Carson.
Thank you, Dr. Carson.
Thank you, Senator.
Governor Huckabee.
Thank you, Governor.
Thank you, governor, I want to turn to ISIS.
Governor Walker…
Thank you, Governor.
Senator Paul, I want to go to you, because you have said that the boots on the ground to fight ISIS need to be Arab boots.
We just learned today that despite the Obama administration spending $500 million to help create those Arab boots, there are only four or five U.S.
trained fighters in Syria fighting ISIS.
What does that say to you about the effectiveness of the idea of the boots on the ground need to be Arab boots?
Thank you, Senator.
Thank you.
Sure….
…Thank you, Governor…
…Thank you, Governor.
Dana Bash…
Thank you, Mrs. Fiorina…
…Thank you….
…Thank you, we're going to turn now to domestic issues with Dana Bash.
…Dana Bash…
Thank you.
(APPLAUSE)
Dana Bash?
Governor Bush, let's talk about the issue that's very important to Republican voters, and that's the Supreme Court.
After Chief Justice John Roberts voted to uphold Obamacare twice, Senator Cruz criticized your brother for appointing John Roberts to the Supreme Court.
Looking back on it, did your brother make a mistake?
…Is John Roberts one of those people?
Do you like what you just heard, Senator Cruz?
Thank you, Senator.
…Governor Bush…
…I want to let you respond.
Thank you, Governor…
…And, that's what we should do, and I hope I'll be working members of the United States Senate to fight hard for the passage of people that have that kind of qualification.
Senator Cruz, 30 seconds.
Thank you, Semator.
Thank you, Senator.
Thank you, Governor.
Thank you, Governor.
Thank you, Governor.
We're going to take a quick break.
Coming up, one of the hottest questions that you have been asking us via social media.
We will pose it to the candidates.
That's coming up right after this.
Welcome back to CNN's Republican presidential debate at the Reagan Library here in Simi Valley — Simi Valley, California.
Many people on social media wanted us to ask about marijuana legalization.
Senator Paul, Governor Christie recently said, quote, "if you're getting high in Colorado today," where marijuana has been legalized, "enjoy it until January 2017, because I will enforce the federal laws against marijuana." Will you?
I want to give that — I want to give the person that you called a hypocrite an opportunity to respond.
Do you want to identify that person?
Is there somebody you were specifically thinking of?
That's what I though, but I wanted (inaudible) to say it.
OK.
Governor Bush, please.
I want to go right now — I want to go right now…
That's true.
Go ahead, Christie, please.
You may respond, and then I'll bring in you, Ms.
Fiorina.
Yes, Senator Paul.
I want to bring in Ms.
Fiorina — I want to bring in Ms.
Fiorina on this issue.
Hugh — Hugh, I'd like to…
Thank you, Jake.
Tomorrow is — Republicans know this — tomorrow is Constitution Day.
We've been talking about the 10th Amendment.
Let's talk about the Second Amendment.
Governor Bush, one of the things the Supreme Court has gotten right is that it's an individual right and it's protected for individuals to hold it.
Last week, you said the next step in gun issues is to make sure they're not in the hands of mentally ill.
In this state, there's a controversial law that allows guns to be taken away from people without a hearing.
Where does it go — and the problem of violence is endemic, but where does it go from what you said last week, how far into people's lives to take guns away from them?
If a family member calls and says, "My child, my brother, my sister is disturbed," ought the state be able to go and get their weapon without a hearing?
Thank you, Senator.
Senator Cruz, I want to go to you.
Your constitutional litigant (ph), are you afraid of the next- step theory of what happens to Second Amendment rights?
Thank you, Senator.
Thank you, Senator.
Thank you, senator.
I'd like to turn it over — I'd like to turn to Dana Bush.
Mr. Trump, you have said once or twice that you are really rich, and you are by far the richest person on this stage.
Chris Christie says billionaires like you and even people who make and earn far less should no longer get Social Security, or at least there should be limits based on — on their income.
You think he's wrong, and if so, why?
What about the country as a — as a policy?
Thank you, Governor.
I'm coming to you right now on a separate issue, sir.
We received…
We received a lot of questions from social media about climate change.
Senator Rubio, Ronald Reagan's secretary of state, George Shultz, reminds us that when Reagan was president he faced a similar situation to the one that we're facing now.
There were dire warnings from the mass consensus of the scientific community about the ozone layer shrinking.
Shultz says Ronald Reagan urged skeptics in industry to come up with a plan.
He said, do it as an insurance policy in case the scientists are right.
The scientists were right.
Reagan and his approach worked.
Secretary Shultz asks, why not take out an insurance policy and approach climate change the Reagan way?
I'm citing George Shultz.
Governor Christie, you have said that climate change is real, and that humans help contribute to it.
Without getting into the issue of China versus the United States, which I understand you've talked about before, what do you make of skeptics of climate change such as Senator Rubio?
Just for the record, I was citing Secretary of State George Shultz, Ronald Reagan's secretary of state who I don't think anybody would call him left-wing.
I called you a skeptic.
I want to go another question right now.
Thank you, Governor.
I'm turning to…
…I'm turning to another — I'm turning to another issue right now.
Senator Cruz.
Well, I think we've heard from several this evening.
A backlash against vaccines was blamed for a measles outbreak here in California.
Dr. Carson, Donald Trump has publicly and repeatedly linked vaccines, childhood vaccines, to autism, which, as you know, the medical community adamantly disputes.
You're a pediatric neurosurgeon.
Should Mr. Trump stop saying this?
Mr. Trump, as president, you would…
I'm going right to you.
Mr. Trump, as president, you would be in charge of the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health, both of which say you are wrong.
How would you handle this as president?
Thank you.
Dr. — Dr. Carson?
Dr. Carson, you just heard his medical take.
Dr. Paul? Dr. Paul, I'd like to bring you in.
Alright, thank you so much…
Coming up — I'm sorry, Governor Huckabee, please.
Thank you, Governor.
We have to take another quick break.
Coming up, Ronald Reagan looming large over this debate.
So how Reaganesque exactly are these Republicans? We will find out next.
Welcome back to CNN's Republican Presidential Debate at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley, California.
We have a few last questions for you.
Two of them a little lighthearted, the other one more serious.
We'll start with one of the more light questions.
Senator Paul, I'm going to start with you and we're just going to go down the line.
Earlier this year, the Treasury Department announced that a woman will appear on the $10 bill.
What woman would you like to see on the $10 bill?
Governor Huckabee?
Senator Paul (sic).
I'm sorry.
Senator Rubio?
Just the senators.
Senator Cruz?
Dr. Carson?
Mr. Trump.
Governor Bush.
Governor Walker.
Mrs. Fiorina.
Governor Kasich.
Governor Christie.
Alright.
Some good entries if anybody at the mint was listening.
Here's the next lighthearted question, you all know that the United States Secret Service uses codenames for the president, and his family.
Ronald Reagan's codename, for example, was, "Rawhide", an homage to his performances in Westerns.
Nancy Reagan's was, "Rainbow".
You don't have to come up the one for your spouse, but, what would you want, Governor Christie, I'll start with you, your Secret Service codename to be.
Governor Walker?
Mr. Trump?
Dr. Carson?
Senator Cruz?
Senator Rubio?
Governor Huckabee.
Senator Paul.
That's a mouthful, but OK.
OK, here's the more serious question, Ronald Reagan, the 40th President, used the plane behind you to accomplish a great many things.
Perhaps, most notably, to challenge Mikhail Gorbachev to tear down the wall, and ultimately, to make peace with the USSR.
How will the world look different once your Air Force One is parked in the hangar of your presidential library?
Senator Paul?
That concludes this Republican presidential debate.
On behalf of everyone here at CNN, we want to thank the candidates, the Reagan Library, and the Republican National Committee.
Thank you, also, to Hugh Hewitt and Dana Bash.
It is nine p.m.
on the East Coast, and the moment of truth has arrived.
Welcome to the first debate night of the 2016 presidential campaign, live from Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio.
Less than a year from now, in this very arena, one of these 10 candidates or one of the seven on the previous debate tonight will accept the Republican party's nomination.
Also of note, Fox News is partnering for tonight's debate with Facebook.
For the past several weeks, we've been asking you for questions for the candidates on Facebook.
Nearly 6 million of you, 6 million, viewed the debate videos on our site, and more than 40,000 of you submitted questions: some of which you will hear us asking the candidates tonight.
As for the candidates who will be answering those questions? Here they are.
Positioned on the stage by how they stand in the polls, in the center of the stage tonight, businessman Donald Trump.
Neurosurgeon, Dr. Ben Carson.
Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.
Brett — Brett, I think you would call that a home field advantage.
It might be.
It might be.
We'll see.
It might be.
The rules for tonight are simple.
One minute for answers, 30 seconds for follow-ups.
And if a candidate runs over, you'll hear this.
Pleasant, no?
We also have a big crowd here with us tonight in the home of the Cavaliers, as I mentioned.
And while we expect them…
Gentlemen, we know how much you love hand-raising questions.
So we promise, this is the only one tonight: the only one.
Is there anyone on stage, and can I see hands, who is unwilling tonight to pledge your support to the eventual nominee of the Republican party and pledge to not run an independent campaign against that person.
Again, we're looking for you to raise your hand now — raise your hand now if you won't make that pledge tonight.
Mr. Trump.
The place where the RNC will give the nominee the nod.
And that experts say an independent run would almost certainly hand the race over to Democrats and likely another Clinton.
You can't say tonight that you can make that pledge?
So tonight, you can't say if another one of these…
OK.
Dr. Paul.
OK.
Just to be clear, you can't make a — we're gonna — we're going to move on.
You're not gonna make the pledge tonight?
OK.
Alright.
Gentlemen, our first round of questions is on the subject of electability in the general election, and we start tonight with you, Dr. Carson.
You are a successful neurosurgeon, but you admit that you have had to study up on foreign policy, saying there's a lot to learn.
Your critics say that your inexperience shows.
You've suggested that the Baltic States are not a part of NATO, just months ago you were unfamiliar with the major political parties and government in Israel, and domestically, you thought Alan Greenspan had been treasury secretary instead of federal reserve chair.
Aren't these basic mistakes, and don't they raise legitimate questions about whether you are ready to be president?
Senator Rubio, when Jeb Bush announced his candidacy for presidency, he said this: "There's no passing off responsibility when you're a governor, no blending into the legislative crowd."
Could you please address Governor Bush across the stage here, and explain to him why you, someone who has never held executive office, are better prepared to be president than he is, a man who you say did a great job running your state of Florida for eight years.
Governor Bush, you have insisted that you're your own man.
You say you have a life experience uniquely your own.
Not your father's, not your brother's.
But there are several opponents on this stage who get big- applause lines in early voting states with this line: quote, "the last thing the country needs is another Bush in the Oval Office."
So do you understand the real concern in this country about dynastic politics?
Mr. Trump, one of the things people love about you is you speak your mind and you don't use a politician's filter.
However, that is not without its downsides, in particular, when it comes to women.
You've called women you don't like "fat pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals."
No, it wasn't.
For the record, it was well beyond Rosie O'Donnell.
Your Twitter account has several disparaging comments about women's looks.
You once told a contestant on Celebrity Apprentice it would be a pretty picture to see her on her knees.
Does that sound to you like the temperament of a man we should elect as president, and how will you answer the charge from Hillary Clinton, who was likely to be the Democratic nominee, that you are part of the war on women?
Senator Cruz, your colleague, Senator Paul, right there next to you, said a few months ago he agrees with you on a number of issues, but he says you do nothing to grow the party.
He says you feed red meat to the base, but you don't reach out to minorities.
You have a toxic relationship with GOP leaders in Congress.
You even called the Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell a liar recently.
Governor Christie, you're not exactly the darling of conservatives.
You tout your record as a Republican governor in a blue state.
On Facebook, the most people talking about you, not surprisingly, come from your state of New Jersey, and one of the top issues they are talking about is the economy.
This — this may be why.
Under your watch, New Jersey has undergone nine credit rating downgrades.
The state's 44th in private sector growth.
You face an employee pension crisis and the Garden State has the third highest foreclosure rate in the country.
So why should voters believe that your management of the country's finances would be any different?
Governor Walker, you've consistently said that you want to make abortion illegal even in cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother.
You recently signed an abortion law in Wisconsin that does have an exception for the mother's life, but you're on the record as having objected to it.
Would you really let a mother die rather than have an abortion, and with 83 percent of the American public in favor of a life exception, are you too out of the mainstream on this issue to win the general election?
Governor Huckabee, like Governor Walker, you have staked out strong positions on social issues.
You favor a constitutional amendment banning same sex marriage.
You favor a constitutional amendment banning abortions, except for the life of the mother.
Millions of people in this country agree with you, but according to the polls, and again this an electability question, according to the polls, more people don't, so how do you persuade enough Independents and Democrats to get elected in 2016?
Senator Paul, you recently blamed the rise of ISIS on Republican hawks.
You later said that that statement, you could have said it better.
But, the statement went on, and you said, quote, "Everything they've talked about in foreign policy, they've been wrong for the last 20 years."
Why are you so quick to blame your own party?
Governor Kasich, You chose to expand Medicaid in your state, unlike several other governors on this stage tonight, and it is already over budget by some estimates costing taxpayers an additional $1.4 billion in just the first 18 months.
You defended your Medicaid expansion by invoking God, saying to skeptics that when they arrive in heaven, Saint Peter isn't going to ask them how small they've kept government, but what they have done for the poor.
Why should Republican voters, who generally want to shrink government, believe that you won't use your Saint Peter rationale to expand every government program?
Gentlemen, we're turning to a new subject that all of you have been talking about and some of you have been disagreeing about, and that is the issue of immigration.
Governor Bush, you released a new plan this week on illegal immigration focusing on enforcement, which some suggest is your effort to show that you're not soft on that issue.
I want to ask you about a statement that you made last year about illegal immigrants.
And here's what you said.
"They broke the law, but it's not a felony, it's an act of love.
It's an act of commitment to your family."
Do you stand by that statement and do you stand by your support for earned legal status?
Thank you, sir.
Mr. Trump, it has not escaped anybody's notice that you say that the Mexican government, the Mexican government is sending criminals — rapists, drug dealers, across the border.
Governor Bush has called those remarks, quote, "extraordinarily ugly."
Mr. Trump, I'll give you 30 seconds — I'll give you 30 seconds to answer my question, which was, what evidence do you have, specific evidence that the Mexican government is sending criminals across the border? Thirty seconds.
All right.
Obviously there's a lot more to talk about this.
We're going to have more questions for the candidates on illegal immigration, plus other key topics including your questions on Facebook.
Welcome back to FOX News/Facebook Republican Debate Night.
We're going to continue the questions now on illegal immigration.
We kind of ended with a cliffhanger there.
So let's continue the conversation.
Governor Kasich, I know you don't like to talk about Donald Trump.
But I do want to ask you about the merit of what he just said.
When you say that the American government is stupid, that the Mexican government is sending criminals, that we're being bamboozled, is that an adequate response to the question of illegal immigration?
Respectfully, can we talk about illegal immigration?
All right, well, Senator Rubio, let me see if I can do better with you.
Is it as simple as our leaders are stupid, their leaders are smart, and all of these illegals coming over are criminals?
Governor Walker.
Governor Walker, from 2002 until as recently as 2013, just two years ago, you supported comprehensive immigration reform, including a path to citizenship.
Now you say that was a quick reaction to something you hadn't really thought about, and that you've changed your mind.
Other than politics, could you explain why in the last two years you've changed your position on a path to citizenship, and are there other past positions that we shouldn't hold you to?
Alright, gentlemen, we're gonna switch topics now and talk a bit about terror and national security.
Governor Christie.
You've said that Senator Paul's opposition to the NSA's collection of phone records has made the United States weaker and more vulnerable, even going so far as to say that he should be called before Congress to answer for it if we should be hit by another terrorist attack.
Do you really believe you can assign blame to Senator Paul just for opposing he bulk collection of people's phone records in the event of a terrorist attack?
Go ahead, sir.
Governor Christie, make your point.
Go ahead, governor.
Alright.
Alright, we've gotta cut it off there.
We have plenty more we want to get to.
That was an interesting exchange, thank you for that.
Well, I want to move on, because I have — we're gonna get to you, governor, but I — I really wanna get to a Facebook questioner.
His name is Alex Chalgren, and he has the following question:
You don't see it as…
…an ideological problem — an ideological problem in addition to a military one?
Governor Bush, for days on end in this campaign, you struggled to answer a question about whether knowing what we know now…
…we would've invaded Iraq…
I remember it too, and ISIS, of course, is now thriving there.
You finally said, "No."
To the families of those who died in that war who say they liberated and deposed a ruthless dictator, how do you look at them now and say that your brothers war was a mistake?
Governor Walker, in February you said that we needed to gain partners in the Arab world.
Which Arab country not already in the U.S.
led coalition has potential to be our greatest partner?
Dr. Carson, in one of his first acts as commander in chief, President Obama signed an executive order banning enhanced interrogation techniques in fighting terror.
As president, would you bring back water boarding?
We have a lot for you, don't worry.
Fear not, you may rue that request.
Gentlemen, the next series of questions deals with ObamaCare and the role of the federal government.
Mr. Trump, ObamaCare is one of the things you call a disaster.
Saying it needs to be repealed and replaced.
Now, 15 years ago, uncalled yourself a liberal on health care.
You were for a single-payer system, a Canadian-style system.
Why were you for that then and why aren't you for it now?
But on ObamaCare…
Mr. Trump, hold up one second.
All right, now, hold on, Senator Paul…
OK.
All right, let me…
Mr. Trump, it's not just your past support for single- payer health care.
You've also supported a host of other liberal policies.
Use — you've also donated to several Democratic candidates, Hillary Clinton included, Nancy Pelosi.
You explained away those donations saying you did that to get business-related favors.
And you said recently, quote, "When you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do."
So what specifically did…
— they do?
Hold on.
We're going to — we're going to move on.
We'll come back to you, Governor Walker.
We have many questions to come.
Many questions to come.
Governor Huckabee, on Facebook, John Pietricone asked this, "Will you abolish or take away the powers and cut the size of the EPA, the IRS, the Department of Education?"
Now, broadly…
— broadly, the size of government is a big concern for Facebook users, Facebook persons, as well as, obviously, conservatives.
But year after year, decade after decade, there are promises from Republicans to shrink government.
But year after year, decade after decade, it doesn't happen.
In fact, it gets bigger, even under Republican politicians.
So the question is, at this point, is the government simply too big for any one person, even a Republican, to shrink?
Dr. Carson…
Dr. Carson, do you agree with that?
Governor Bush?
We're going to come back to you, Dr. Carson.
Governor Bush, you are one of the few people on the stage who advocates for Common Core education standards, reading and math.
A lot of people on this stage vigorously oppose federal involvement in education.
They say it should all be handled locally.
President Obama's secretary of education, Arnie Duncan, has said that most of the criticism of Common Core is due to a, quote, "fringe group of critics." Do you think that's accurate?
Senator Rubio, why is Governor Bush wrong on Common Core?
And do you agree with your old friend?
We have many more questions coming on a host of topics, here from Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland.
Stay with us.
We have many more questions coming on a host of topics.
Here from Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland.
Stay with us.
Gentlemen, we're obviously digging into some subjects in depth, but we're also going to change it up every once in a while throughout the next hour and have many rounds where we ask, you are not going to like it, only a couple of candidates questions on those subjects.
This is the first of the many rounds, and it's about somebody whose name probably hasn't been mentioned enough so far tonight.
Governor Kasich, let me start with you.
Whoever the Republican nominee —
Whoever the Republican nominee is, it looks at least for now like whoever that nominee is, he or she, will be facing off against Hillary Clinton.
You know how she will come after whoever the Republican nominee is.
She will say that you, whoever it is, support the rich while she supports the middle class.
That you want to suppress the rights of women and minorities.
She wants to move the country forward while you, the Republicans, want to take the country back to the past.
How will you, if you're the nominee, how will you answer that and take Hillary Clinton on?
I know that all of you would like to answer this question, but we're only going to ask one other candidate before we move on to a different subject, Dr. Carson.
Basically, same question to you.
If Hillary Clinton is the nominee and she comes at you with that kind of line of attack, how will you take Iraq?
Gentlemen, we're going to turn now to the subject of the economy, jobs and money and the government.
And Governor Bush, I'm going to start with you.
You have made a bold promise in your announcement.
You have promised four percent economic growth and 19 million new jobs if you are fortunate enough to serve two terms as president.
That many jobs, 19 million, would be triple what your father and your brother accomplished together.
And four percent growth, the last president to average that was Lyndon Johnson during the height of the Vietnam War.
So question, how on Earth specifically would you pull that off?
Governor Walker.
Governor Christie, I want to engage you and Governor Huckabee in a subject that is a big issue in both of your campaigns, and that is entitlement reform.
You say that you — to save the system that you want to raise the retirement age — have to raise the retirement age, and to cut benefits for Social Security and Medicare, and you say that some of the candidates here on the stage are lying.
Governor Huckabee says he can save Social Security and Medicare without doing any of that.
Is he lying?
Governor Huckabee?
You say that changing entitlements, the kind of thing that Governor Christie is talking about, would be breaking a promise to the American people, and you say that you can keep those programs, save Social Security, save Medicare, without those kinds of reforms through a Fair (ph) tax, which is a broad tax on consumption.
Please explain to Governor Christie how that would work, and how you could save these programs without the kind of painful reforms he says we need?
…Thirty seconds.
…Alright, this is it.
Thirty Seconds, finally.
All right.
Enough.
Mr. Trump.
(OFF MIKE) Sounds like somebody's a little R-rated.
Mr. Trump, you talk a lot about how you are the person on this stage to grow the economy.
I want to ask you about your business record.
Trump corporations — Trump corporations, casinos and hotels, have declared bankruptcy four times over the last quarter-century.
In 2011, you told Forbes Magazine this: "I've used the laws of the country to my advantage." But at the same time, financial experts involved in those bankruptcies say that lenders to your companies lost billions of dollars.
Question sir, with that record, why should we trust you to run the nation's business?
No, but the concept sir…
… that's your line, but your companies have gone bankrupt.
Well sir, let's just talk about the latest example…
Is that the way that you'd run the country?
So…
Senator Rubio.
Senator Rubio, more than 3,000 people sent us questions about the economy and jobs on Facebook.
And here is a video question from Tania Cioloko from Philadelphia.
Here she is.
Senator, how do you answer Tania?
Senator Rubio, thank you.
Gentlemen, another question for a few of you.
Yesterday, just yesterday, President Obama criticized Republican lawmakers trying to block the Iran deal, calling them knee-jerk partisans, adding that hardliners in Iran who chant "death to America" were quote, "making common cause with the Republican caucus."
Here's what two of your opponents on the five p.m.
debate stage said about Iran.
Now, I wanna ask a few of you this.
First, Governor Walker.
You've said that you would tear up the Iran deal on day one.
If this deal is undone, what then?
Senator Paul, would you tear up the deal on day one?
Governor Huckabee, what do you think about what Senator Paul just said?
Thank you, gentlemen.
Well, the first debate night of the 2016 presidential campaign continues from Cleveland after a short time-out.
Stick around.
Social issues, next.
Welcome back, gentleman.
We're going to move on now to discuss some social issues across the board.
Governor Bush, let's start with you.
Many Republicans have been outraged recently by a series of videos on Planned Parenthood.
You now say that you support ending federal funding for this organization.
However, until late 2014, right before you started your campaign, you sat on the board of a Bloomberg charity that quite publicly gave tens of millions of dollars to Planned Parenthood while you were a director.
How could you not know about these well publicized donations, and if you did know, how could you help a charity so openly committed to abortion rights?
Did you know it?
Senator Rubio, you favor a rape and incest exception to abortion bans.
Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York just said yesterday those exceptions are preposterous.
He said they discriminate against an entire class of human beings.
If you believe that life begins at conception, as you say you do, how do you justify ending a life just because it begins violently, through no fault of the baby?
You don't favor a rape and incest exception?
Mr. Trump, in 1999, you said you were, quote, "very pro- choice." Even supporting partial-birth abortion.
You favored an assault weapons ban as well.
In 2004, you said in most cases you identified as a Democrat.
Even in this campaign, your critics say you often sound more like a Democrat than a Republican, calling several of your opponents on the stage things like clowns and puppets.
When did you actually become a Republican?
Governor Bush, I want to ask you, on the subject of name calling of your fellow candidates, a story appeared today quoting an anonymous GOP donor who said you called Mr. Trump a clown, a buffoon, something else that cannot be repeated on television.
Is it true?
Mr. Trump, 30 seconds.
The subject of gay marriage and religious liberty.
Governor Kasich, if you had a son or daughter who was gay or lesbian, how would you explain to them your opposition to same-sex marriage?
How would you — how would you explain it to a child?
Thank you.
Welcome back to Cleveland.
Our next topic is foreign policy.
Candidates, you may not have seen the late developing news today our Fox Pentagon team broke earlier this evening about a top Iranian general traveling to Moscow to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
His name is General Qassem Soleimani, he's blamed for hundreds of U.S.
troops death in Iraq, and Afghanistan.
His trip to Russia appears to directly violate U.N.
Security Council resolutions to confine him to Iran.
So, Mr. Trump, if you were president, how would you respond to this?
Another new development today, Senior Defense officials tell Fox they strongly suspect Russia was behind the cyber attack on the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs office…
…email.
This comes in the wake of the director of national intelligence blaming the Chinese for the largest ever cyber attack, stealing personal data of tens of millions of Americans.
Senator Cruz, in your view, have Russia and China committed of cyber war, and if you were president, what would you do about it?
Dr. Carson, in August of 2012 President Obama famously declared Syrian President Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons, quote, "that's a red line for us," and that there would be enormous consequences.
One year later, and with overwhelming evidence the Assad had, in fact, used chemical weapons and crossed that red line, President Obama declined to use military force against the Assad regime.
As president, would you have used military force there?
Governor Walker, as president, what would you do if Russian President Vladimir Putin started a campaign to destabilize NATO allies Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, mirroring the actions Putin took at the early days of Ukraine?
Governor — Governor Huckabee, the culture of the American military is definitely changing.
Women are moving into combat roles.
Don't Ask, Don't Tell has obviously been dropped.
And now Defense Secretary Ashton Carter recently directed the military to prepare for a moment when it is welcoming transgender persons to serve openly.
As commander in chief, how would you handle that?
Senator Paul, the first budget your proposed as senator cut all financial aid to Israel.
You have since changed your view on that issue.
What made you change your mind.
OK.
But you still say that Israel could be one of the countries that is cut from financial aid?
Governor Christie, what do you think of that answer?
Governor, thank you.
Senator, we're going to finish up with some more questions, thank you.
We have to stand you by, because after the break, we're going to let the candidates make their closing statements, their final thoughts, and God.
Stay tuned for that.
Welcome back.
In our final moments here together, we're going to allow the candidates to offer their final thoughts.
But first, we want to ask them an interesting closing question from Chase Norton on Facebook, who wants to know this of the candidates: "I want to know if any of them have received a word from God on what they should do and take care of first."
Senator Cruz, start from you.
Any word from God?
Governor Kasich, same question.
Governor Walker, same question.
Senator Rubio, I want to ask you the same question.
But I do want to mention, a woman just came here to the stage and asked, what about the veterans? I want to hear more about what these candidates are going to do for our nation's veterans.
So I put the question to you about God and the veterans, which you may find to be related.
Dr. Carson, a question to you about God and his role, but also, one of the issues that the public was very interested in, and we touched on it earlier, is race relations in this country, and how divided we seem right now.
And what, if anything, you can do — you would do as the next president to help heal that divide.
Now each candidate will make a closing statement.
You'll all have 30 seconds to make a closing statement for this <debate>.
We'll start with Ohio Governor John Kasich.
Governor Christie?
Senator Paul, closing statement.
Senator Marco Rubio.
Thank you, Senator.
Senator Ted Cruz.
Dr. Carson, closing statement.
Governor Mike Huckabee, closing statement.
Governor Scott Walker.
Governor Bush, closing statement, sir.
Mr. Trump, closing statement, sir.
Gentlemen, thank you.
It's over!
That's it.
Are you relieved? You were nervous before, they — they don't look relieved.
They look "get me outta here."
