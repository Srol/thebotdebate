I think maybe my greatest weakness is that I trust people too much.
I'm too trusting.
And when they let me down, if they let me down, I never forgive.
I find it very, very hard to forgive people that deceived me.
So I don't know if you would call that a weakness, but my wife said "let up."
Right.
Right.
That's right.
No, not a comic book, and it's not a very nicely asked question the way you say that.
Larry Kudlow is an example, who I have a lot of respect for, who loves my tax plan.
We're reducing taxes to 15 percent.
We're bringing corporate taxes down, bringing money back in, corporate inversions.
We have $2.5 trillion outside of the United States which we want to bring back in.
As far as the wall is concerned, we're going to build a wall.
We're going to create a border.
We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
They're going to come in legally.
And it's something that can be done, and I get questioned about that.
They built the great wall of China.
That's 13,000 miles.
Here, we actually need 1,000 because we have natural barriers.
So we need 1,000.
We can do a wall.
We're going to have a big, fat beautiful door right in the middle of the wall.
We're going to have people come in, but they're coming in legally.
And Mexico's going to pay for the wall because Mexico — I love the Mexican people; I respect the Mexican leaders — but the leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders.
And just to finish, people say, how will you get Mexico to pay? A politician other than the people in the states — I don't want to — a politician cannot get them to pay.
I can.
We lose, we have a trade imbalance…
Excuse me, John.
… of $50 billion…
… believe me the world is peanuts by comparison.
Right.
Dynamically.
Then you have to get rid of Larry Kudlow, who sits on your panel, who's a great guy, who came out the other day and said, I love Trump's tax plan.
First of all, John got lucky with a thing called fracking, OK? He hit oil.
He got lucky with fracking.
Believe me, that is why Ohio is doing well.
Number — and that is important for you to know.
Number two, this was the man that was a managing general partner at Lehman Brothers when it went down the tubes and almost took every one of us with it, including Ben and myself, because I was there and I watched what happened.
And Lehman Brothers started it all.
He was on the board.
And he was a managing general partner.
And just thirdly, he was so nice.
He was such a nice guy.
And he said, oh, I'm never going to attack.
But then his poll numbers tanked.
He has got — that is why he is on the end.
I think you're —
Well, first of all, like many other very big businessmen, I could name them here, but I'm not going to do that for a lot of obvious reasons, but the biggest, and almost all of them, they've all used the chapter laws, the bankruptcy laws to their own benefit.
Before this, I was a very successful person as a developer and as a businessman.
Atlantic City has gone bad.
I mean, Chris will know about that.
I'm not blaming Chris, by the way, but he will know about that.
Caesar's — excuse me — Caesar's, the Rolls-Royce, as you know, is in bankruptcy.
Almost every hotel in Atlantic City has either been in bankruptcy or will be in bankruptcy — the biggest.
But also the biggest people (ph) — now I've used that to my advantage as a business man, for my family, for myself.
I never filed for bankruptcy.
But many, many people did.
What happened with Atlantic City is very, very disgraceful.
Now hundreds of companies I've opened.
I've used it three times, maybe four times.
Came out great.
But I guess I'm supposed to come out great.
That is what I could do for the country.
We owe $19 trillion, boy am I good at solving debt problems.
Nobody can solve it like me.
But I will tell you this, Atlantic City, you're using that, hundreds of companies that I have opened have thrived.
I built a net worth of way over $10 billion, and I have done it four times out of hundreds.
And I'm glad I did it.
I used the laws of the country to my benefit, I'm sorry.
Thank you.
I was not at all critical of him.
I was not at all.
In fact, frankly, he's complaining about the fact that we're losing some of the most talented people.
They go to Harvard.
They go to Yale.
They go to Princeton.
They come from another country and they're immediately sent out.
I am all in favor of keeping these talented people here so they can go to work in Silicon Valley.
So I have nothing at all critical of him.
Probably, I don't know — you people write the stuff.
I don't know where you…
And if I could say just one thing.
I am the only person in either campaign that's self-funding.
I'm putting up 100 percent of my own money.
And right now, I will be putting up a tremendous — so far, I've put up less than anybody and I have the best results.
Wouldn't that be nice if the country could do that?
But I will be putting — I will be putting up, you know, tremendous amounts of money.
SuperPacs are a disaster.
They're a scam.
They cause dishonesty.
And you better get rid of them because they are causing a lot of bad decisions to be made by some very good people.
And I'm not blaming these folks — well, I guess I could.
I never said that.
I never said that.
You've got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not…
… he's really doing some bad…
I never said that.
I never said that.
He has got another gentleman in Florida, who happens to be a very nice guy, but not…
Everybody is really doing some bad fact…
I'm in favor of people coming into this country legally.
And you know what? They can have it anyway you want.
You can call it visas, you can call it work permits, you can call it anything you want.
I've created tens of thousands of jobs, and in all due respect — and actually some of these folks I really like a lot — but I'm the only one that can say that.
I have created tens of thousands of jobs, and I'll be creating many millions of jobs if I'm given — if I'm given the opportunity to be president.
As far as Mark is concerned, as far as the visas are concerned, if we need people, they have — it's fine.
They have to come into this country legally.
We have a country of borders.
We have a country of laws.
We have to obey the laws.
It's fine if they come in, but they have to come in legally.
Yes.
Or somebody else.
Right.
Yes, I might feel more comfortable.
I would say that I would and I have a permit, which is very unusual in New York — a permit to carry.
And I do carry on occasion, sometimes a lot.
But I like to be unpredictable so that people don't know exactly… (LAUGHTER)
By the way, unlike our country where we're totally predictable and the enemy, whether it's ISIS or anybody else, they know exactly what we're doing because we have the wrong leadership.
I would change them.
I would change them.
Such a nasty — such a nasty question, but thank you, Governor.
Yes, it's very simple.
We're going to make a really dynamic economy from what we have right now, which is not at all dynamic.
We're going to bring jobs back from Japan, we're going to bring jobs back from China, we're going to bring, frankly, jobs back from Mexico where, as you probably saw, Nabisco is leaving Chicago with one of their biggest plants, and they're moving it to Mexico.
We're going to bring jobs and manufacturing back.
We're going to cut costs.
We're going to save Social Security, and we're going to save Medicare.
Our country doesn't win anymore.
We used to win, we don't win anymore.
We lose on trade.
We lose with ISIS.
We lose with one of the worst deals I've ever seen negotiated of any kind, that's our recent catastrophe with Iran.
We don't win.
Let me give you one quick example.
These folks, CNBC, they had it down at three, three and a half hours.
I just read today in the New York Times, $250,000 for a 30 second ad.
I went out and said, it's ridiculous.
Nobody — I could stand up here all night.
Nobody wants to watch three and a half, or three hours.
It was a back sacrifice, and I have to hand it to Ben.
We called Ben, he was with me 100%.
We called in, we said, that's it.
We're not doing it.
They lost a lot of money, everybody said it couldn't be done.
Everybody said it was going to be three hours, three and a half, including them, and in about two minutes I renegotiated it so we can get the hell out of here.
Not bad.
And, I'll do that with the country.
We will make America great again.
And, thank you everybody.
Just for the record.
That's not right.
That is absolutely not right.
You know that.
That is not right.
I'm Donald Trump.
I wrote "The Art of the Deal".
I say not in a braggadocious way, I've made billions and billions of dollars dealing with people all over the world, and I want to put whatever that talent is to work for this country so we have great trade deals, we make our country rich again, we make it great again.
We build our military, we take care of our vets, we get rid of Obamacare, and we have a great life altogether.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Well, first of all, Rand Paul shouldn't even be on this stage.
He's number 11, he's got 1 percent in the polls, and how he got up here, there's far too many people anyway.
As far as temperament — and we all know that — as far as temperament, I think I have a great temperament.
I built a phenomenal business with incredible, iconic assets, one of the really truly great real-estate businesses.
And I may be an entertainer, because I've had tremendous success with number-one bestsellers all over the place, with "The Apprentice" and everything else I've done.
But I will tell you this: What I am far and away greater than an entertainer is a businessman, and that's the kind of mindset this country needs to bring it back, because we owe $19 trillion right now, $19 trillion, and you need this kind of thinking to bring our country back.
And believe me, my temperament is very good, very calm.
But we will be respected outside of this country.
We are not respected now.
I never attacked him on his look, and believe me, there's plenty of subject matter right there.
But I have to say…
Well, in Wisconsin…
Excuse me.
In Wisconsin, you're losing $2.2 billion right now.
I would do so much better than that.
No.
I'm using facts.
Every major business leader has used the — I never went bankrupt, by the way, as you know, everybody knows.
But we — hundreds of companies, hundreds of deals, I've used
I didn't —
Totally false.
I would have gotten it.
I promise I would have gotten it.
I promise if I wanted it, I would have gotten it.
I know my people.
I know my people.
No.
I just will tell you that, you know, Jeb made the statement.
I'm not only referring to him.
I — a lot of money was raised by a lot of different people that are standing up here.
And the donors, the special interests, the lobbyists have very strong power over these people.
That's true.
That's true.
I was — excuse me, Jeb.
I was a businessman, I got along with Clinton, I got along with everybody.
That was my job, to get along with people.
I didn't want to — excuse me.
One second.
OK, more energy tonight.
I like that.
I didn't want — it was my obligation as a businessman to my family, to my company, to my employees, to get along with all politicians.
I get along with all of them, and I did a damn good job in doing it.
Go ahead.
Got along with everybody.
Wrong.
Don't make things up.
Jeb, don't make things up.
Come on.
Don't make things up.
So, number one, they have to respect you.
He has absolutely no respect for President Obama.
Zero.
Syria's a mess.
You look at what's going on with ISIS in there, now think of this: we're fighting ISIS.
ISIS wants to fight Syria.
Why are we fighting ISIS in Syria? Let them fight each other and pick up the remnants.
I would talk to him.
I would get along with him.
I believe — and I may be wrong, in which case I'd probably have to take a different path, but I would get along with a lot of the world leaders that this country is not getting along with.
We don't get along with China.
We don't get along with the heads of Mexico.
We don't get along with anybody, and yet, at the same time, they rip us left and right.
They take advantage of us economically and every other way.
We get along with nobody.
I will get along — I think — with Putin, and I will get along with others, and we will have a much more stable — stable world.
I believe that I will get along — we will do — between that, Ukraine, all of the other problems, we won't have the kind of problems that our country has right now with Russia and many other nations.
TAPPER: Senator Rubio, you've taken a very different approach to the — the question of Russia.
You've called Vladimir Putin a, quote, "gangster."
Why would President Rubio's approach be more effective than President Trump's?
TRUMP(?): …Slow (ph) and steady, (inaudible) chicken…
I wouldn't have drawn the line, but once he drew it, he had no choice but to go across.
They do bear some responsibility, but I think he probably didn't do it, not for that reason.
Somehow, he just doesn't have courage.
There is something missing from our president.
Had he crossed the line and really gone in with force, done something to Assad — if he had gone in with tremendous force, you wouldn't have millions of people displaced all over the world.
They had a responsibility, absolutely.
I think we have three of them here…
I think they had a responsibility, yes.
Jeb, just…
I think it will haunt him.
I think it's a terrible.
I think it's going to haunt him absolutely.
He came back later and he said he misspoke.
There was no question because I heard when he said the statement.
I was watching and he said the statement.
And I said, wow, I can't believe it.
I will take care of women.
I respect women.
I will take care of women.
One thing we will say and I would like to get back to the Iran situation.
We're talking about Iran.
The agreement was terrible.
It was incompetent.
I've never seen anything like it.
One of the worst contracts of any kind I've ever seen.
And nobody ever mentions North Korea where you have this maniac sitting there and he actually has nuclear weapons and somebody better start thinking about North Korea and perhaps a couple of other places.
But certainly North Korea.
And Ted and I have spoken.
We've — a lot of us have spoken.
We're talking about Iran.
They are bad actors, bad things are going to happen.
But in the meantime, you have somebody right now in North Korea who has got nuclear weapons and who is saying almost every other week, I'm ready to use them.
And we don't even mention it.
So why didn't you say it? Why didn't you say it?
I know, but why did you say it? I heard it myself.
Why did you say it?
You said you're going to cut funding for women's health.
You said it.
You said it.
I think she's got a beautiful face, and I think she's a beautiful woman.
Correct.
First of all, I want to build a wall, a wall that works.
So important, and it's a big part of it.
Second of all, we have a lot of really bad dudes in this country from outside, and I think Chris knows that, maybe as well as anybody.
They go, if I get elected, first day they're gone.
Gangs all over the place.
Chicago, Baltimore, no matter where you look.
We have a country based on laws.
I will make sure that those laws are adhered to.
These are illegal immigrants.
I don't think you'd even be asking this question if I didn't run because when I ran, and I brought this up, my opening remarks at Trump Tower, I took heat like nobody has taken heat in a long time.
And, then they found out with the killing of Katie, from San Francisco, and so many other crimes, they found out that I was right.
And, most people, many people, apologized to me.
I don't think you'd even be talking about illegal immigration if it weren't for me.
So, we have a country of laws, they're going to go out, and they'll come back if they deserve to come back.
If they've had a bad record, if they've been arrested, if they've been in jail, they're never coming back.
We're going to have a country again.
Right now, we don't have a country, we don't have a border, and we're going to do something about it, and it can be done with proper management, and it can be done with heart.
…By the way, I agree with — with what Chris is saying, but, I will say this.
Illegal immigration is costing us more than $200 billion dollars a year just to maintain what we have.
…(INAUDIBLE)…
Correct.
Well, I have to tell you, I hear phenomenal things.
I hear your wife is a lovely woman…
I don't know her, and this is a total mischaracterization…
Good.
No, I won't do that, because I've said nothing wrong.
But I do hear she's a lovely woman.
Jeb said…
… that they come into our country as an act of love.
With all of the problems we that we have, in so many instances — we have wonderful people coming in.
But with all of the problems — this is not an act of love.
He's weak on immigration — by the way, in favor of Common Core, which is also a disaster, but weak on immigration.
He doesn't get my vote.
Not with this intensity.
As I said, we are spending $200 billion — we are spending $200 billion a year on maintaining what we have.
We will move them out.
The great ones will come back, the good ones will come back.
They'll be expedited, they'll be back, they'll come back legally.
We'll have a country — they'll come back, legally.
Well, I think it's wonderful and all, but I did it a little bit half-heartedly, but I do mean it to a large extent.
We have a country, where, to assimilate, you have to speak English.
And I think that where he was, and the way it came out didn't sound right to me.
We have to have assimilation — to have a country, we have to have assimilation.
This is a reporter, not a high school kid.
Well, first of all, the — the 14th Amendment says very, very clearly to a lot of great legal scholars — not television scholars, but legal scholars — that it is wrong.
It can be corrected with an act of Congress, probably doesn't even need that.
A woman gets pregnant.
She's nine months, she walks across the border, she has the baby in the United States, and we take care of the baby for 85 years.
I don't think so.
And by the way, Mexico and almost every other country anywhere in the world doesn't have that.
We're the only ones dumb enough, stupid enough to have it.
And people — and by the way, this is not just with respect to Mexico.
They are coming from Asia to have babies here, and all of a sudden, we have to take care of the babies for the life of the baby.
The 14th Amendment, it reads properly, you can go and — it's probably going to be have to be check — go through a process of court, probably ends up at the Supreme Court, but there are a lot of great legal scholars that say that is not correct.
And in my opinion, it makes absolutely no — we're the only — one of the only countries, we're going to take care of those babies for 70, 75, 80, 90 years? I don't think so.
I agree 100 percent, by the way, with Carly on the fact that the Democrats do not want to solve this problem, for the obvious reasons, but they do not.
But I believe that a reading of the 14th Amendment allows you to have an interpretation where this is not legal and where it can't be done.
I've seen both sides, but some of the greatest scholars agree with me, without having to go through Congress.
If you do go through Congress, you can absolutely solve the problem.
That's true, sure.
— let me — well, let me just explain.
The head of the Yale Business School, Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, wrote a paper recently, one of the worst tenures for a CEO that he has ever seen, ranked one of the top 20 in the history of business.
The company is a disaster and continues to be a disaster.
They still haven't recovered.
In fact, today, on the front page of the Wall Street Journal, they fired another 25 or 30,000 people saying we still haven't recovered from the catastrophe.
When Carly says the revenues went up, that's because she bought Compaq, it was a terrible deal, and it really led to the destruction of the company.
Now one other company before that was Lucent.
Carly was at Lucent before that.
And Lucent turned out to be a catastrophe also.
So I only say this.
She can't run any of my companies.
That I can tell you.
I never filed for bankruptcy.
I'll tell you why; it's very simple.
I'll tell you.
I was running —
— Carly, Carly —
— I've made over $10 billion.
I had a casino company — Caesars just filed for bankruptcy.
Chris will tell you — it's not Chris' fault either — but almost everybody in Atlantic City is either in trouble or filed for — maybe I'll blame Chris.
But Atlantic City is a disaster —
Wait a minute, Carly.
Wait.
I let you speak.
Atlantic City is a disaster, and I did great in Atlantic City.
I knew when to get out.
My timing was great.
And I got a lot of credit for it.
Many of the great business people that you know — and Carl Icon (ph) is going to work with me on making great deals for this country.
But whether it's Carl or so many others that we read about all the time —
— they have used the laws of the land, which is the —
…Well, I'd like to respond, I'd like to respond…
Well, I think the thing about the flat tax, I know it very well.
What I don't like is that if you make $200 million a year, you pay ten percent, you're paying very little relatively to somebody that's making $50,000 a year, and has to hire H&R Block to do the — because it's so complicated.
One thing I'll say to Ben is that we've had a graduated tax system for many years, so it's not a socialistic thing.
What I'd like to do, and I'll be putting in the plan in about two weeks, and I think people are going to like it, it's a major reduction in taxes.
It's a major reduction for the middle class.
The hedge fund guys won't like me as much as they like me right now.
I know them all, but they'll pay more.
I know people that are making a tremendous amount of money and paying virtually no tax, and I think it's unfair.
Well, I heard Hugh Hewitt, a nice man, he apologized because he actually said that we had a misunderstanding.
And he said today that Donald Trump is maybe the best interview there is anywhere that he has ever done.
Now unless he was just saying that on CNN to be nice, but he did say that…
And we had a legitimate misunderstanding in terms of his pronunciation of a word.
But I would say just…
Well, I think it was.
And he actually said that.
Did you say that?
OK.
So I will say this, though, Hugh was giving me name after name, Arab name, Arab name, and there are few people anywhere, anywhere that would have known those names.
I think he was reading them off a sheet.
And frankly I will have — and I told him, I will have the finest team that anybody has put together and we will solve a lot of problems.
You know, right now they know a lot and look at what is happening.
The world is blowing up around us.
We will have great teams and great people.
I hope that answers your question.
I mean, you are in the Senate, but I hope that answers your question.
No, I don't think he's suggesting that at all.
I mean…
I don't think he's suggesting that at all.
Well, you have to understand, I am not sitting in the United States Senate with, by the way, the worst voting record there is today.
Number one.
I am not sitting in the United States Senate.
I'm a businessman doing business transactions.
I am doing business transactions.
I will know more about this — and, as you said, that was very acceptable, and when you listen to that whole interview, it's a great interview, you said it, I didn't.
Well, now I did.
But…
Listen, just one second.
Just one second.
I will know…
…I will know more about the problems of this world by the time I sit, and you look at what's going in this world right now by people that supposedly know, this world is a mess.
(inaudible)
(inaudible) I'm — and I'm meeting with people that are terrific people, but I have to say something because it's about judgment.
I am the only person on this dais — the only person — that fought very, very hard against us (ph), and I wasn't a sitting politician going into Iraq, because I said going into Iraq — that was in 2003, you can check it out, check out — I'll give you 25 different stories.
In fact, a delegation was sent to my office to see me because I was so vocal about it.
I'm a very militaristic person, but you have to know when to use the military.
I'm the only person up here that fought against going into Iraq.
Just excuse me, one second, Rand…
If you don't mind, Rand — you know, you are on last — you do have your 1 percent.
I would like — and I think it's very important.
I think it's important, because it's about judgment.
It's about judgment.
I didn't want to go into Iraq, and I fought it, because what I said — what I said…
… was you're going to — you're going to destabilize…
… the Middle East, and that's what happened.
If you think about it…
Your brother — and your brother's administration gave us Barack Obama, because it was such a disaster, those last three months, that Abraham Lincoln couldn't have been elected.
I don't know.
You feel safe right now? I don't feel so safe.
Or the collapse of the economy.
Speaking for myself, I'm OK with it.
I think there's a certain truth to it.
I know people that, frankly, it has no impact on their life whatsoever.
There are many people.
I would almost say leave it up to them, but I would be willing to check it off, and say I will not get Social Security.
I do not…
As a policy, I would almost leave it up to the people.
Don't forget they pay in and they pay in, and maybe they do well, and maybe some people want it.
But the fact is that there are people that truly don't need it, and there are many people that do need it very, very badly.
And I would be willing to write mine off 100 percent, Dana.
Well, I — I — I'd like to respond.
I'd like to respond.
Autism has become an epidemic.
Twenty-five years ago, 35 years ago, you look at the statistics, not even close.
It has gotten totally out of control.
I am totally in favor of vaccines.
But I want smaller doses over a longer period of time.
Because you take a baby in — and I've seen it — and I've seen it, and I had my children taken care of over a long period of time, over a two or three year period of time.
Same exact amount, but you take this little beautiful baby, and you pump — I mean, it looks just like it's meant for a horse, not for a child, and we've had so many instances, people that work for me.
Just the other day, two years old, two and a half years old, a child, a beautiful child went to have the vaccine, and came back, and a week later got a tremendous fever, got very, very sick, now is autistic.
I only say it's not — I'm in favor of vaccines, do them over a longer period of time, same amount.
But just in — in little sections.
I think — and I think you're going to have — I think you're going to see a big impact on autism.
And that's all I'm saying, Jake.
That's all I'm saying.
Well, because she's been sitting for three hours, I think my daughter, Ivanka, who's right here.
Other than that we'll go with Rosa Parks.
I like that.
Humble.
If I become president, we will do something really special.
We will make this country greater than ever before.
We'll have more jobs.
We'll have more of everything.
We were discussing disease, we were discussing all sorts of things tonight, many of which will just be words, it will just pass on.
I don't want to say politicians, all talk, no action.
But a lot of what we talked about is words and it will be forgotten very quickly.
If I'm president, many of the things that we discussed tonight will not be forgotten.
We'll find solutions.
And the world will respect us.
They will respect us like never before.
And it will be actually a friendlier world.
And I have to say, it is a great honor to be here tonight.
I fully understand.
I fully understand.
I cannot say.
I have to respect the person that, if it's not me, the person that wins, if I do win, and I'm leading by quite a bit, that's what I want to do.
I can totally make that pledge.
If I'm the nominee, I will pledge I will not run as an independent.
But — and I am discussing it with everybody, but I'm, you know, talking about a lot of leverage.
We want to win, and we will win.
But I want to win as the Republican.
I want to run as the Republican nominee.
Well, I've given him plenty of money.
I will not make the pledge at this time.
Only Rosie O'Donnell.
Thank you.
Yes, I'm sure it was.
I think the big problem this country has is being politically correct.
So, if it weren't for me, you wouldn't even be talking about illegal immigration, Chris.
You wouldn't even be talking about it.
This was not a subject that was on anybody's mind until I brought it up at my announcement.
And I said, Mexico is sending.
Except the reporters, because they're a very dishonest lot, generally speaking, in the world of politics, they didn't cover my statement the way I said it.
The fact is, since then, many killings,murders, crime, drugs pouring across the border, are money going out and the drugs coming in.
And I said we need to build a wall, and it has to be built quickly.
And I don't mind having a big beautiful door in that wall so that people can come into this country legally.
But we need, Jeb, to build a wall, we need to keep illegals out.
Border Patrol, I was at the border last week.
Border Patrol, people that I deal with, that I talk to, they say this is what's happening.
Because our leaders are stupid.
Our politicians are stupid.
And the Mexican government is much smarter, much sharper, much more cunning.
And they send the bad ones over because they don't want to pay for them.
They don't want to take care of them.
Why should they when the stupid leaders of the United States will do it for them? And that's what is happening whether you like it or not.
A complete disaster, yes.
Correct.
First of all, I'd like to just go back to one.
In July of 2004, I came out strongly against the war with Iraq, because it was going to destabilize the Middle East.
And I'm the only one on this stage that knew that and had the vision to say it.
And that's exactly what happened.
And the Middle East became totally destabilized.
So I just want to say.
As far as single payer, it works in Canada.
It works incredibly well in Scotland.
It could have worked in a different age, which is the age you're talking about here.
What I'd like to see is a private system without the artificial lines around every state.
I have a big company with thousands and thousands of employees.
And if I'm negotiating in New York or in New Jersey or in California, I have like one bidder.
Nobody can bid.
You know why?
Because the insurance companies are making a fortune because they have control of the politicians, of course, with the exception of the politicians on this stage.
But they have total control of the politicians.
They're making a fortune.
Get rid of the artificial lines and you will have…
— yourself great plans.
And then we have to take care of the people that can't take care of themselves.
And I will do that through a different system.
I'm not — I'm not are — I don't think you heard me.
You're having a hard time tonight.
You'd better believe it.
If I ask them, if I need them, you know, most of the people on this stage I've given to, just so you understand, a lot of money.
Many of them.
Not much.
But I…
Good.
Sounds good.
Sounds good to me, Governor.
I will tell you that our system is broken.
I gave to many people, before this, before two months ago, I was a businessman.
I give to everybody.
When they call, I give.
And do you know what?
When I need something from them two years later, three years later, I call them, they are there for me.
And that's a broken system.
Well, I'll tell you what, with Hillary Clinton, I said be at my wedding and she came to my wedding.
You know why?
She didn't have a choice because I gave.
I gave to a foundation that, frankly, that foundation is supposed to do good.
I didn't know her money would be used on private jets going all over the world.
It was.
But…
Because I have used the laws of this country just like the greatest people that you read about every day in business have used the laws of this country, the chapter laws, to do a great job for my company, for myself, for my employees, for my family, et cetera.
I have never gone bankrupt, by the way.
I have never.
But out of hundreds of deals…
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Excuse me, what am I saying? Out of hundreds of deals that I've done, hundreds, on four occasions I've taken advantage of the laws of this country, like other people.
I'm not going to name their names because I'm not going to embarrass, but virtually every person that you read about on the front page of the business sections, they've used the law.
The difference is, when somebody else uses those laws, nobody writes about it.
When I use it, they say, "Trump, Trump, Trump." The fact is, I built a net worth of more than $10 billion.
I have a great, great company.
I employ thousands of people.
And I'm very proud of the job I did.
Again Chris, hundreds and hundreds of deals.
Four times, I've taken advantage of the laws.
And frankly, so has everybody else in my position.
Well, I…
Let me just tell you about the lenders.
First of all, these lenders aren't babies.
These are total killers.
These are not the nice, sweet little people that you think, OK?
And by the way, this country right now owes $19 trillion.
And they need somebody like me to straighten out that mess.
I don't think they like me very much.
I'll tell you what.
I've evolved on many issues over the years.
And you know who else has? Is Ronald Reagan evolved on many issues.
And I am pro-life.
And if you look at the question, I was in business.
They asked me a question as to pro-life or choice.
And I said if you let it run, that I hate the concept of abortion.
I hate the concept of abortion.
And then since then, I've very much evolved.
And what happened is friends of mine years ago were going to have a child, and it was going to be aborted.
And it wasn't aborted.
And that child today is a total superstar, a great, great child.
And I saw that.
And I saw other instances.
And I am very, very proud to say that I am pro-life.
As far as being a Republican is concerned, I come from a place, New York City, which is virtually, I mean, it is almost exclusively Democrat.
And I have really started to see some of the negatives — as an example, and I have a lot of liking for this man, but the last number of months of his brother's administration were a catastrophe.
And unfortunately, those few months gave us President Obama.
And you can't be happy about that.
First of all, Jeb, I am very happy that you denied that, and I appreciate that very much.
He is a true gentleman.
He really is.
One thing he did say, and I mean that.
The one thing he did say about me, however, was my tone.
And I also understand that.
But when you have people that are cutting Christians' heads off, when you have a world that the border and at so many places, that it is medieval times, we've never — it almost has to be as bad as it ever was in terms of the violence and the horror, we don't have time for tone.
We have to go out and get the job done.
I would be so different from what you have right now.
Like, the polar opposite.
We have a president who doesn't have a clue.
I would say he's incompetent, but I don't want to do that because that's not nice.
But if you look at the deals we make, whether it's the nuclear deal with 24 hour periods — and by the way, before you get to the 24 hours, you have to go through a system.
You look at Sergeant Bergdahl, we get Bergdahl, a traitor, and they get five of the big, great killers leaders that they want.
We have people in Washington that don't know what they're doing.
Now…
I agree.
Now, with Iran, we're making a deal, you would say, we want him.
We want out our prisoners.
We want all these things, and we don't get anything.
We're giving them $150 billion dollars plus, they are going to be — I'll tell you what, if Iran was a stock, you folks should go out and buy it right now because you'll quadruple — this, what's happening in Iran, is a disgrace, and it's going to lead to destruction in large portions of the world.
Our country is in serious trouble.
We don't win anymore.
I've actually been in politics all my life, although I've been on that side as opposed to this side.
I'm now a politician for about three months.
Obviously, I'm doing pretty well.
I'm number one in every polls (sic) by a lot.
But the qualification is that I've dealt with people all over the world, been successful all over the world.
Everything I've done virtually has been a tremendous success.
When markets changed, when things turned, I heard Governor Pataki, who, by the way, was a failed governor in New York, a very seriously failed — he wouldn't be elected dog catcher right now.
I heard what he had to say.
And I will tell you this: Atlantic City, I've made a tremendous amount of money in Atlantic City.
I left seven years ago, I've gotten great credit for my timing, and that's what I'm all about.
